# BlocNotes
Summary

Bloc Notes is a simple note taking app that uses Core Data for persistence. It simply needed to save and edit notes, and list them as well as provide a search feature. It was the first project I built, and the main skills I learned were Core Data, UITableView, UIActivityViewController, iOS 8 Extensions, UISearchController, UIDataDetectorTypes and integration with iCloud.

Explanation

The Bloc iOS Development program is divided into two main phases: Foundation and Projects. After completing the many tutorials in Foundation, it's time to build things on your own. You chose from a selection of projects, and build the apps yourself without sample code. Bloc Notes is designed to introduce you to Core Data and other associated APIs.
